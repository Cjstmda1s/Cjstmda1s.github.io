### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
    Lab 1 was one of my favorite lab because, although it was not the most exciting lab, it provided me with the fundamental knowledge of using Github. Throughout the lab, as I was unfamiliar with using terminal, it felt refreshing accessing Github using terminals. Not only it taught be about GitHub and terminals, but it also taught me about navigating through directory, which was esstential part of this class.

* Lab 4
    Lab 4 part 2 was one of my favorite lab because of the usage of if statements and loop statement for the first time. It was entertaining to use those statements because it provided more of logical thinking behind writing codes, such as how to write codes so only at certain times a certain lines of code works. Throughout future labs, there were more complex form of writing out such statements, so I think this lab also provided as a good foundation before entering those labs.

* Lab 11
    Lab 11 part 2 was one of my favorite lab because of the usage of more complex object-oriented programming. Although we already visited the concept of Hi Lo game, but this time felt more interesting than the previous one because of the usage of PRNG and constructors. Although the game was already functional on the previous version, the newer version seemed more enticing for me since the new code felt more organized with the usage of constructor and functions, and the new functionality of having the secret number automatically randomized instead of being set by the user in terminal also felt more practical.
