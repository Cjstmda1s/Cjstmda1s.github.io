# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Edward Chen and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 1
Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because, although it was not the most exciting lab, it provided me with the fundamental knowledge of using Github. Throughout the lab, as I was unfamiliar with using terminals, it felt refreshing accessing Github using terminals. Not only it taught be about GitHub and terminals, but it also taught me about navigating through the directory, which was an essential part of this class.

* Lab 4
Lab 4 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because of the usage of if statements and loop statements for the first time. It was entertaining to use those statements because they provided more logical thinking behind writing codes, such as how to write codes so only at certain times do certain lines of code work. Throughout future labs, there was a more complex form of writing out such statements, so I think this lab also provided a good foundation before entering those labs.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 part 2 was one of my favorite labs because of the usage of more complex object-oriented programming. Although we already visited the concept of the Hi-Lo game, this time felt more interesting than the previous one because of the usage of PRNG and constructors. Although the game was already functional on the previous version, the newer version seemed more enticing for me since the new code felt more organized with the usage of constructor and functions, and the new functionality of having the secret number automatically randomized instead of being set by the user in the terminal also felt more practical.
